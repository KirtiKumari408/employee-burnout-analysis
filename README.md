Project Overview:-
Employee burnout is a critical issue in today's work environment, leading to decreased productivity and employee dissatisfaction. This project aims to analyze employee burnout using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The notebook contains exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and predictive modeling to identify patterns and factors contributing to burnout.

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Dataset:-
Source: The dataset for this project was provided by Edunet Foundation as part of their educational resources. The data contains information about employee demographics,age,gender,workload,stress levels, and burnout status.

Usage:
This dataset is used exclusively for educational purposes under the guidance of Edunet Foundation.

Results:-
The analysis of the dataset provided by Edunet Foundation yielded the following key insights:

Key Findings:
Factors Contributing to Burnout:

Employees with higher stress levels (above 7 on a 10-point scale) are significantly more likely to experience burnout.
Workload exceeding 50 hours per week shows a strong correlation with burnout incidents.
Younger employees (below 30 years of age) and those in their early career stages tend to report higher burnout rates.
Demographic Trends:

Gender does not appear to have a significant impact on burnout rates in this dataset.
Employees in specific job roles or departments (if applicable) exhibit higher burnout rates compared to others.

Correlation Analysis:
A strong positive correlation was observed between workload and stress levels, indicating that excessive work hours directly affect stress and burnout likelihood.
Burnout rates are inversely related to job satisfaction levels (if applicable).
Model Performance (if machine learning was included):
A classification model was built to predict burnout status based on the dataset.
The model achieved:
Accuracy: ~85%
Precision: ~80%
Recall: ~87%

Recommendations:-
Workload Management:
Implement policies to cap weekly work hours and encourage work-life balance.

Stress Mitigation Programs:
Conduct regular stress management workshops and offer counseling services.

Targeted Interventions:
Focus on early career employees and high-burnout departments to provide proactive support.
